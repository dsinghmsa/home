    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This is a custom Chrome profile made by Devin. It should log out your accounts when you close the browser, but make sure to log out just in case! It's pre-configured to do these things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Block ads and annoyances</li>
      <li>Prevent pages from tracking you (without breaking them)</li>
      <li>Speed up page loading and responsiveness</li>
      <li>Don't interfere with any other profiles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please don't change any settings as they aren't meant to be changed. Here's some useful quick access links:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://google.com">Google Search</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://classroom.google.com">Google Classroom</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>Many websites (including online games) have tons of advertising and tracking built into them, so that's what this stops.</p>
    <p>If any pages require you to turn off your ad blocker, simply go to the extensions button and disable UBlock Origin for that site.</p>
